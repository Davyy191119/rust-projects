<br>

This repository serves as a hands-on exploration of implementing various machine learning algorithms and concepts using the Rust programming language. The goal is to leverage Rust's performance, safety, and strong typing to build efficient and reliable machine learning components.

<br>

## ‚ú® Concepts Covered (So Far):

* **[Concept 1 Name]:** [Linear Regression - Implemented with basic gradient descent.]
* **[Concept 2 Name]:** [K-Means Clustering - Basic implementation available.]
* **[Concept 3 Name]:** [Neural Network (Feedforward) - Initial structure defined.]
* **[And so on...]**

**Planned Concepts:**

* [large language models training ]

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. You can find installation instructions on the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Running Examples

Each concept typically has its own example or test case that demonstrates its usage.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Davyy191119]/[rust-projects].git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [rust-projects]
    ```
3.  **Run a specific example (using `cargo run`):**
    ```bash
    cd [concept_directory_name] # E.g., cd linear_regression
    cargo run
    ```
    Or, to run all examples/tests:
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```

### Exploring the Code

The codebase is organized into modules, with each module focusing on a specific machine learning concept. You can find the source code within the `src` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

* **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** - The programming language used.
* **[ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray)** - For efficient multi-dimensional array manipulation.
* **[rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand)** - For random number generation .
* **[serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) and [serde_derive](https://crates.io/crates/serde_derive)** - For serialization and deserialization .
* **[Other relevant crates you are using]**
